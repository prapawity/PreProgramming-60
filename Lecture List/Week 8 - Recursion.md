> Recursion is a way of programming or coding a problem, in which a function calls itself one or more times in its body. Usually, it is returning the return value of this function call. If a function definition fulfils the condition of recursion, we call this function a recursive function. - python-course.eu

# Example of use in recursion
Calculating 4! without using built-in function
```python
def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n-1)
factorial(4)
```

The Pitfalls of Recursion

This subchapter of our tutorial on recursion deals with the Fibonacci numbers. What do have sunflowers, the Golden ratio, fur tree cones, The Da Vinci Code and the song "Lateralus" by Tool in common. Right, the Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers of the following sequence of integer values:

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, ...

The Fibonacci numbers are defined by:
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with F0 = 0 and F1 = 1

The Fibonacci sequence is named after the mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, who is better known as Fibonacci. In his book "Liber Abaci" (publishes 1202) he introduced the sequence as an exercise dealing with bunnies. His sequence of the Fibonacci numbers begins with F1 = 1, while in modern mathematics the sequence starts with F0 = 0. But this has no effect on the other members of the sequence.

The Fibonacci numbers are the result of an artificial rabbit population, satisfying the following conditions:
a newly born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, build the initial population
these rabbits are able to mate at the age of one month so that at the end of its second month a female can bring forth another pair of rabbits
these rabbits are immortal
a mating pair always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month onwards
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers of rabbit pairs after n months, i.e. after 10 months we will have F10 rabbits.

The Fibonacci numbers are easy to write as a Python function. It's more or less a one to one mapping from the mathematical definition:
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
An iterative solution for the problem is also easy to write, though the recursive solution looks more like the mathematical definition:
def fibi(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
If you check the functions fib() and fibi(), you will find out that the iterative version fibi() is a lot faster than the recursive version fib(). To get an idea of how much this "a lot faster" can be, we have written a script where we you the timeit module to measure the calls:

from timeit import Timer
from fibo import fib

t1 = Timer("fib(10)","from fibo import fib")

for i in range(1,41):
	s = "fib(" + str(i) + ")"
	t1 = Timer(s,"from fibo import fib")
	time1 = t1.timeit(3)
	s = "fibi(" + str(i) + ")"
	t2 = Timer(s,"from fibo import fibi")
	time2 = t2.timeit(3)
	print("n=%2d, fib: %8.6f, fibi:  %7.6f, percent: %10.2f" % (i, time1, time2, time1/time2))
time1 is the time in seconds it takes for 3 calls to fib(n) and time2 respectively the time for fibi(). If we look at the results, we can see that calling fib(20) three times needs about 14 milliseconds. fibi(20) needs just 0.011 milliseconds for 3 calls. So fibi(20) is about 1300 times faster then fib(20).
fib(40) needs already 215 seconds for three calls, while fibi(40) can do it in 0.016 milliseconds. fibi(40) is more than 13 millions times faster than fib(40).

What's wrong with our recursive implementation?

Let's have a look at the calculation tree, i.e. the order in which the functions are called. fib() is substituted by fib().

fib() calculation tree

We can see that the subtree f(2) appears 3 times and the subtree for the calculation of f(3) two times. If you imagine extending this tree for f(6), you will understand that f(4) will be called two times, f(3) three times and so on. This means, our recursion doesn't remember previously calculated values.

We can implement a "memory" for our recursive version by using a dictionary to save the previously calculated values.
memo = {0:0, 1:1}
def fibm(n):
    if not n in memo:
        memo[n] = fibm(n-1) + fibm(n-2)
    return memo[n]
We time it again to compare it with fibi():
from timeit import Timer
from fibo import fib

t1 = Timer("fib(10)","from fibo import fib")

for i in range(1,41):
	s = "fibm(" + str(i) + ")"
	t1 = Timer(s,"from fibo import fibm")
	time1 = t1.timeit(3)
	s = "fibi(" + str(i) + ")"
	t2 = Timer(s,"from fibo import fibi")
	time2 = t2.timeit(3)
	print("n=%2d, fib: %8.6f, fibi:  %7.6f, percent: %10.2f" % (i, time1, time2, time1/time2))
